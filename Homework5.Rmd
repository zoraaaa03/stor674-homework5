# Part 1: Git and GitHub Concepts (20 points)

## Question 1.1: Understanding Commits (5 points)

**a)** (3 points) What does a commit do in Git? Explain what information is stored in a commit.

**Answer:**

A commit in Git creates a snapshot of the entire project at a specific point in time. Each commit stores the complete state of all tracked files (a full snapshot rather than just the differences), along with metadata such as the authors' names and emails, the time stamp of when the commit was made, and the commit message describing the changes. It also includes a unique SHA-1 hash that identifies the commit, as well as pointers to its parent commit or commits, which together form the project’s history chain.


**b)** (2 points) Why is it important to write descriptive commit messages? Provide an example of a good commit message and a bad commit message.

**Answer:**

Writing descriptive commit messages is important because it makes the project history clear and useful for both you and your collaborators. Good messages help developers understand what changed and why, speed up debugging by making it easier to locate relevant commits, and improve long-term maintainability when revisiting code months later. Following a standard structure—such as a short summary under 50 characters followed by an optional detailed explanation—helps keep commit messages concise and informative.

Good commit message example:
Fix RestartCleaner naming assumption for restart files

Bad commit message example:
update
fix

## Question 1.2: Branching in Git (10 points)

**a)** (5 points) Explain how branching works in Git. What happens when you create a new branch? What command would you use to create a new branch called `feature-analysis` and switch to it?

**Answer:**

Branching in Git works by creating a new pointer to a specific commit rather than copying the entire project. When a new branch is created, Git simply adds a new reference that initially points to the same commit as the current branch (such as main). The two branches diverge only when new commits are made, with each branch pointer moving independently.

To create and switch to a new branch called feature-analysis, you can use a single command:

git checkout -b feature-analysis

Or perform the two steps separately:

git branch feature-analysis; git checkout feature-analysis.

**b)** (5 points) Git branching is often described as "super lightweight" compared to other version control systems. Explain why Git branching is lightweight. (Hint: Think about how Git stores branches and what happens under the hood when you create a branch.)

**Answer:**

Git branching is "super lightweight" because branches are just pointers that point to specific commits, not copies of the entire code base. 

Unlike other version control systems (like SVN) that create branches by copying all project files to a new directory—which can take minutes for large projects and consume gigabytes of space. Git creates a branch instantly by simply writing a new pointer file.

All branches share the same repository objects (commits, trees, blobs) and only the pointer moves as new commits are made. This makes creating, switching, and deleting branches nearly instantaneous operations regardless of project size.


## Question 1.3: Merging Branches (5 points)

**a)** (3 points) What is the purpose of merging branches? Describe the steps you would take to merge a branch called `feature-analysis` into the `main` branch.

**Answer:**

The purpose of merging branches is to integrate changes from one branch into another, typically bringing feature work back into the main branch. It keeps the main branch stable, enables parallel development, allows for code reviews through pull requests, provides roll back safety, and maintains project history.

Steps to merge feature-analysis into main (local merge):
1. Switch to the target branch: `git checkout main`
2. Ensure main is up-to-date: `git pull origin main` (if working with remote)
3. Merge the feature branch: `git merge feature-analysis`
4. Push the updated main to remote: `git push origin main` (optional)

In collaborative environments, merging is often done via Pull Requests on GitHub/GitLab, which adds code review and CI testing before the merge, rather than direct local merging.

**b)** (2 points) What is a merge conflict and when does it occur?

**Answer:**

A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes from different branches 
because the same part of a file has been modified in incompatible ways on both branches. 
Git doesn't know which version to keep, so it requires human intervention to resolve.

Merge conflicts happen when:
1. Two branches modify the same lines in a file differently
2. One branch deletes a file while another branch modifies it
3. Both branches add different content at the same location in a file

To avoid merge conflicts:
1. Pull latest changes frequently: `git pull origin main`
2. Keep branches short-lived and merge often
3. Communicate with team members about who's working on which files
4. Make small, focused commits that are easier to merge
5. Regularly sync your feature branch with main to catch conflicts early

# Part 2: Docker Image Creation and Deployment with Version Control (50 points)

In this section, you will create a Docker image that can run the `compute_bench.py` script (which you used in Homework 2), which benchmarks CPU/GPU performance using PyTorch. **You will version control the entire process using Git and GitHub, practicing branching and merging workflows.**

**Important Note on Operating Systems:** You may be working on macOS or Windows, but Docker containers run Linux by default. You will be building a **Linux-based container** that will run on Longleaf (which is also Linux). Docker handles the cross-platform compatibility automatically, so your Linux container built on macOS/Windows will work seamlessly on Longleaf's Linux environment.

## Question 2.0: GitHub Repository Setup (5 points)

Before building your Docker image, you will set up version control for your project.

**a)** (1 points) Create a new GitHub repository called `stor674-homework5` (or similar name). Initialize it with a README. Provide the GitHub repository URL.

**GitHub Repository URL:**

<!-- Your GitHub repo URL here -->


**b)** (2 points) Clone the repository to your local machine, add the provided files (`compute_bench.py`, this `Homework5.Rmd`), and make your initial commit. What commands did you use?

**Answer:**

```bash
# Commands you used





```

**c)** (2 points) Create a new branch called `docker-build` where you will develop your Dockerfile. What command did you use? Why is it good practice to use a separate branch for development instead of working directly on `main`?

**Answer:**

```bash
# Command to create and switch to branch


```

**Explanation:**

<!-- Why use a separate branch? -->


## Question 2.1: Understanding compute_bench.py (5 points)

**a)** (3 points) Read the `compute_bench.py` script. What does this script do? What is its main purpose?

**Answer:**

<!-- Write your answer here -->


**b)** (2 points) What Python packages does `compute_bench.py` require?

**Answer:**

<!-- Write your answer here -->


## Question 2.2: Create a Dockerfile (10 points)

Create a Dockerfile that:
- Uses an appropriate **Linux-based** base image with Python 3.9 or later
- Installs the required Python packages (PyTorch with CUDA support for GPU computing)
- Copies `compute_bench.py` into the container
- Sets the default command to run the script

**Important Considerations:**

- **Operating System**: Even if you're on macOS or Windows, Docker will build a Linux container. Use Linux base images (e.g., `python:3.9-slim` is based on Debian Linux).

- **CUDA Support**: Longleaf has NVIDIA GPUs. To enable GPU support in your container:
  - Option 1: Use official PyTorch image with CUDA: `pytorch/pytorch:2.0.0-cuda11.7-cudnn8-runtime`
  - Option 2: Install PyTorch with CUDA support: `pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118`
  - Note: The container itself doesn't need NVIDIA drivers (Longleaf provides those), but PyTorch needs to be CUDA-aware.

- **Testing Locally**: If your computer doesn't have an NVIDIA GPU, the container will still build and run (it will just use CPU). On Longleaf with GPU nodes, it will automatically detect and use the GPU.

**Instructions:**

1. Make sure you're on the `docker-build` branch
2. Create a file named `Dockerfile` in your repository
3. Write the Dockerfile content below:

```dockerfile
# Paste your Dockerfile content here





```

**Grading Criteria:**
- Appropriate Linux base image selection (2 points)
- CUDA-enabled PyTorch installation (4 points)
- Proper file copying (2 points)
- Correct CMD or ENTRYPOINT (2 points)

## Question 3.3: Create Slurm Job Script (12 points)

Create a Slurm job script that runs your containerized `compute_bench.py` using Apptainer.

**Hint:** If you want to test with GPU support on Longleaf, you'll need to:
- Request a GPU partition (e.g., `#SBATCH -p gpu`)
- Request GPU resources (e.g., `#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1`)
- Your CUDA-enabled PyTorch in the container will automatically use the GPU!

**Instructions:**

1. Create a file named `run_compute_bench.sh` in your GitHub repository
2. Include appropriate Slurm directives (partition, time, memory, etc.)
3. Load necessary modules (if needed)
4. Run the Apptainer container

**Your Slurm Script:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Paste your Slurm script here









```

**Grading Criteria:**
- Appropriate Slurm directives (#SBATCH) (4 points)
- Correct Apptainer run command (6 points)
- Output redirection and job organization (2 points)

## Question 3.4: Submit, Verify, and Version Control (3 points)

**a)** (1 point) What command did you use to submit your job to Slurm?

**Answer:**

```bash
# Command here

```

**b)** (2 points) Provide the output of your job. Paste the contents of your Slurm output file (e.g., `slurm-jobid.out`). Also, add your Slurm script (`run_compute_bench.sh`) to your GitHub repository and push it.
